One factor behind these corrections is dust\nextinction, accounted for in the color-luminosity relation of the\nstandardization. This relation is usually assumed to be universal, which could\npotentially introduce systematics into the standardization. The ``mass-step''\nobserved for SNe Ia Hubble residuals has been suggested as one such systematic.\nWe seek to obtain a completer view of dust attenuation properties for a sample\nof 162 SN Ia host galaxies and to probe their link to the ``mass-step''. We\ninfer attenuation laws towards hosts from both global and local (4 kpc) Dark\nEnergy Survey photometry and Composite Stellar Population model fits. We\nrecover a optical depth/attenuation slope relation, best explained by differing\nstar/dust geometry for different galaxy orientations, which is significantly\ndifferent from the optical depth/extinction slope relation observed directly\nfor SNe. We obtain a large variation of attenuation slopes and confirm these\nchange with host properties, like stellar mass and age, meaning a universal SN\nIa correction should ideally not be assumed. Analyzing the cosmological\nstandardization, we find evidence for a ``mass-step'' and a two dimensional\n``dust-step'', both more pronounced for red SNe. Although comparable, the two\nsteps are found no to be completely analogous. We conclude that host galaxy\ndust data cannot fully account for the ``mass-step'', using either an\nalternative SN standardization with extinction proxied by host attenuation or a\n``dust-step'' approach.\n", "authors": ["J.

Currently, in the LISA\nDatacode Challenge, each galactic binary is modeled as a quasi-monochromatic\nsource of GWs. This corresponds to the circular motion of two point-masses at\nthe 2.5 post-Newtonian approximation. If this picture is expected to be an\naccurate description for most of the galactic binaries that LSIA will detect,\nwe nevertheless expect to observe eccentric systems with complex physical\nproperties beyond the point-mass approximation. In this work, we investigate\nhow a binary system of highly magnetic objects in quasi-circular orbit could\naffect the quasi-monochromatic picture of the GW signal detected by LISA. We\ndemonstrate that the eccentricity generates additional frequency peaks at\nharmonics of the mean motion and that magnetism is responsible for shifting\neach frequency peak with respect to the case without magnetism.

This results in a 20 solar-mass model undergoing\nsignificantly more mass loss during the RSG phase than it would have otherwise,\nbut has little effect on models of lower masses.

Moreover, using unbinned CMB data, we perform a first\nconcrete application of the GA by searching for oscillatory features in the\npotential in an agnostic way, and find very significant improvements upon the\nbest featureless potentials, $\\Delta \\chi^2 < -20$. These encouraging\npreliminary results motivate the search for resonant features in the primordial\npower spectrum with a multimodal distribution of frequencies. We stress that\nour pipeline is modular and can easily be extended to other CMB data sets and\ninflationary scenarios, like multifield inflation or theories with higher-order\nderivatives.\n", "authors": ["Ahana Kamerkar", "Savvas Nesseris", "Lucas Pinol"], "comment": "14 pages, 10 figures, 2 tables.

Therefore, our choices were tapered power-law and\ngamma distributions. The power-law portion of the tapered power-law and gamma\ndistributions was found to have a power exponent of 1.35--1.9. Due to the\nexponential fall-off of these distributions, the expected frequencies of large\nsunspots are low. The largest sunspot group observed had an area of 6132 MSH,\nand the frequency of sunspots larger than $10^4$ MSH was estimated to be every\n3 -- 8 $\\times 10^4$ years. We also have estimated the distributions of the\nSun-as-a-star total sunspot areas. The largest total area covered by sunspots\nin the record was 1.67 % of the visible disk, and can be up to 2.7 % by\nartificially increasing the lifetimes of large sunspots in an area evolution\nmodel.

Since\ngalaxy mergers lead to dynamical bulge growth, the only way to observationally\nisolate non-merger growth is to study galaxies with low bulge-to-total mass\nratio (e.g. B/T < 10%). However, bulge growth can also occur due to secular\nprocesses, such as disk instabilities, making disk-dominated selections a\nsomewhat incomplete way to select merger-free systems. Here we use the\nHorizon-AGN simulation to select simulated galaxies which have not undergone a\nmerger since z = 2, regardless of bulge mass, and investigate their location on\ntypical black hole-galaxy scaling relations in comparison to galaxies with\nmerger dominated histories. While the existence of these correlations has long\nbeen interpreted as co-evolution of galaxies and their SMBHs driven by galaxy\nmergers, we show here that they persist even in the absence of mergers. We find\nthat the correlations between SMBH mass and both total mass and stellar\nvelocity dispersion are independent of B/T ratio for both merger-free and\nmerger-dominated galaxies. In addition, the bulge mass and SMBH mass\ncorrelation is still apparent for merger-free galaxies, the intercept for which\nis dependent on B/T. Galaxy mergers reduce the scatter around the scaling\nrelations, with merger-free systems showing broader scatter.

Observations of the galaxy-wide IMF challenge this as dwarf\ngalaxies do not form as many massive stars as expected. This indicates a highly\nself-regulated star formation process in which stellar masses are not\nstochastically sampled from the IMF and are instead related to the environment\nof star formation. Here, the nature of star formation is studied using the\nrelation between the most massive star born in a star cluster and its parental\nstellar cluster mass (the $m_{\\rm max}$--$M_{\\rm ecl}$ relation). This relation\nhas been argued to be a statistical effect if stars are sampled randomly from\nthe IMF. By comparing the tightness of the observed $m_{\\rm max}$--$M_{\\rm\necl}$ distribution with synthetic star clusters with stochastically sampled\nstellar masses, we find that the expected dispersion of the mock observations\nis much larger than the observed dispersion. Assuming that $m_{\\rm max}$ and\n$M_{\\rm ecl}$ uncertainties from the literature are correct, our test rejects\nthe hypothesis that the IMF is a PDF at a more than $4.5\\sigma$ confidence\nlevel. Alternatively, we provide a deterministic stellar mass sampling tool\nwhich reproduces the observed $m_{\\rm max}$--$M_{\\rm ecl}$ distribution and\ncompares well with the luminosities of star-forming molecular clumps. In\naddition, we find that there is a significant flattening of the $m_{\\rm\nmax}$--$M_{\\rm ecl}$ relation near $m_{\\rm max}=13~M_\\odot$. This may suggest\nstrong feedback of stars more massive than about $13~M_\\odot$ and/or the\nejections of the most massive stars from young clusters in the mass range 63 to\n$400~M_\\odot$ to be likely important physical processes in forming clusters.\n", "authors": ["Zhiqiang Yan", "Tereza Jerabkova", "Pavel Kroupa"], "comment": "16 pages, 10 figures.

In 2020 the GRAVITY Collaboration detected\nthe orbital precession of the S2 star around the supermassive black hole (SMBH)\nat the Galactic Center (GC) and showed that it is close to the general\nrelativity (GR) prediction. Using this observational fact, we evaluated\nparameters of the Yukawa gravity (the range of Yukawa interaction $\\Lambda$ and\nuniversal constant $\\delta$) with the Schwarzschild precession of the S-stars\nassuming that the observed Schwarzschild precession will be equal to their GR\nestimates. GR provides the most natural way to fit observational data for\nS-star orbits, however, their precessions can be fitted by Yukawa gravity. Our\nmain goal was to study the possible influence of the strength of Yukawa\ninteraction, i.e. the universal constant $\\delta$, on the precessions of S-star\norbits. We analyze S-star orbits assuming different strength of Yukawa\ninteraction $\\delta$ and find that this parameter has strong influence on range\nof Yukawa interaction $\\Lambda$. Using MCMC simulations we obtain the best-fit\nvalues and uncertanties of Yukawa gravity parameters for S-stars. Also, we\nintroduce a new criterion which can be used for classification of gravitational\nsystems in this type of gravity, according to their scales.

We discuss constraints\non axion dark matter production from the overproduction of the baryon asymmetry\nas well as a minimal, albeit fine-tuned setup, where both the correct dark\nmatter abundance and baryon asymmetry can be achieved. For a given axion decay\nconstant, this leads to a sharp prediction for the mass of the radial direction\nof the Peccei Quinn field, which is a soft mass scale in supersymmetric\ntheories.\n", "authors": ["Raymond T.

Other wavelets, such as Superlets, which may detect fast\ntransient oscillations, will be employed in the future analysis.\n", "authors": ["Andjelka B. Kovacevic", "Aleksandra Nina", "Luka C.

The primary objectives of the mission are to discover and\ncharacterize electromagnetic counterparts to gravitational wave source; and to\nstudy Gamma Ray Bursts (GRBs). Daksha is a versatile all-sky monitor that can\naddress a wide variety of science cases. With its broadband spectral response,\nhigh sensitivity, and continuous all-sky coverage, it will discover fainter and\nrarer sources than any other existing or proposed mission. Daksha can make key\nstrides in GRB research with polarization studies, prompt soft spectroscopy,\nand fine time-resolved spectral studies. Daksha will provide continuous\nmonitoring of X-ray pulsars. It will detect magnetar outbursts and high energy\ncounterparts to Fast Radio Bursts. Using Earth occultation to measure source\nfluxes, the two satellites together will obtain daily flux measurements of\nbright hard X-ray sources including active galactic nuclei, X-ray binaries, and\nslow transients like Novae. Correlation studies between the two satellites can\nbe used to probe primordial black holes through lensing. Daksha will have a set\nof detectors continuously pointing towards the Sun, providing excellent hard\nX-ray monitoring data. Closer to home, the high sensitivity and time resolution\nof Daksha can be leveraged for the characterization of Terrestrial Gamma-ray\nFlashes.\n", "authors": ["Varun Bhalerao", "Disha Sawant", "Archana Pai", "Shriharsh Tendulkar", "Santosh Vadawale", "Dipankar Bhattacharya", "Vikram Rana", "Hitesh Kumar L.

We find that the interplay\nbetween the hadronic matter and quark matter compositions of CrSs can help to\nreconcile the small radii constraints indicated by the LIGO/Virgo GW170817\nevent, the large radii constraints set for massive compact stars by recent\nNICER X-ray observations, and the recent observation of the most-massive pulsar\nPSR J0952-0607.

The total matter energy density follows\nthe standard conservation, and evolution has the character of deceleration in\nthis frame. The model exhibits interesting features in the Jordan frame\nrealized by virtue of a disformal transformation where individual matter\ncomponents adhere to standard conservation but gravity is modified. A generic\nparametrization of disformal transformation leaves thermal history intact. It\ngives rise to late time acceleration in the Jordan frame, which necessarily\nincludes phantom crossing, which, in the standard framework, can be realized\nusing at least two scalar fields. This scenario is embodied by two\ndistinguishing features, namely, acceleration in the Jordan frame and\ndeceleration in the Einstein frame, and the possibility of resolution of the\nHubble tension thanks to the emergence of the phantom phase at late times.\n", "authors": ["Mayukh R.
